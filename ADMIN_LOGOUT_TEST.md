# Admin Dashboard Logout Test Guide

## What was implemented:

### 1. Admin Dashboard Header
- Added a professional user menu in the top-right corner
- Shows current logged-in user information
- Added an avatar with user initials
- Dropdown menu with Profile, Settings, and Logout options

### 2. Logout Functionality
- **Main Navbar**: Already had logout in the user avatar dropdown
- **Admin Dashboard**: Now has a dedicated logout option in the admin user menu
- **Mobile Navbar**: Already had logout functionality

### 3. Role-based Navigation
- Updated navbar to show correct dashboard link based on user role:
  - Admin users → `/admin/dashboard`
  - Student/User → `/student-dashboard`

### 4. Visual Improvements
- Added student role badge (green) for better role identification
- Enhanced admin dashboard header with user status indicator
- Professional styling with proper spacing and colors

## Testing Steps:

### 1. Test Admin Logout from Dashboard
1. Login as an admin user
2. Navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
3. Look for the user menu in the top-right corner (avatar with purple background)
4. Click on the avatar to open the dropdown
5. Click "Log out" (should be in red text)
6. Verify you're redirected to `/login`
7. Verify you can't access admin dashboard without re-authentication

### 2. Test Navbar Logout (Both Desktop and Mobile)
1. Login as any user (admin, student, etc.)
2. **Desktop**: Look for avatar in navbar → click → click "Logout"
3. **Mobile**: Open hamburger menu → scroll down → click "Logout"
4. Verify logout works properly

### 3. Test Role-based Dashboard Links
1. Login as admin → navbar "Dashboard" link should go to `/admin/dashboard`
2. Login as student → navbar "Dashboard" link should go to `/student-dashboard`

## Troubleshooting:

### If Logout Button Not Visible:
1. Check if user is properly authenticated
2. Verify user role is 'admin'
3. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
4. Ensure AuthContext is working properly

### If Logout Doesn't Work:
1. Check browser Network tab for failed API calls
2. Verify backend `/api/auth/logout` endpoint is working
3. Check if cookies are being cleared properly
4. Look for errors in browser console

### If Redirects Don't Work:
1. Verify React Router is configured properly
2. Check if protected routes are working
3. Ensure navigation permissions are correct

## Expected Behavior:

✅ **Working Correctly:**
- Admin can logout from multiple places (navbar + dashboard)
- Logout clears authentication state
- Redirects to login page after logout
- Cannot access protected routes after logout
- Role-based navigation works properly

❌ **Issues to Check:**
- Multiple logout attempts causing errors
- Inconsistent logout behavior between components
- Failed redirects after logout
- Authentication state not clearing properly

## Code Locations:

- **Admin Dashboard**: `frontend/src/pages/AdminDashboardPage.tsx`
- **Navbar Component**: `frontend/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`
- **Auth Context**: `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- **Protected Routes**: `frontend/src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
