            <h2>What is Communication?</h2>
            
            <p>Communication is the process of exchanging information, ideas, thoughts, feelings, and emotions between two or more people. It's a fundamental human skill that we use every day, whether we're speaking with friends, colleagues, or strangers.</p>
            
            <h3>The Communication Process</h3>
            <p>Effective communication involves several key components:</p>
            
            <div class="info-box">
              <h4>Key Components:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Sender:</strong> The person who initiates the communication</li>
                <li><strong>Message:</strong> The information being conveyed</li>
                <li><strong>Channel:</strong> The medium through which the message is sent</li>
                <li><strong>Receiver:</strong> The person who receives the message</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> The response from the receiver</li>

              </div>

                <h4>Non-verbal Communication</h4>
